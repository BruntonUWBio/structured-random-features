Random Features for neuronal tuning
==============================

We want to use ideas from random features literature to model neuronal tuning properties.

Steps to set up the directory:
------------

1. Do a clean download of the repository. Go inside the repo.
        cd \path\to\random_features\
        
2. Make a virtual Conda environment. We will be using python version 3.8.
	conda create --name random_features python=3.8
	
3. Activate the new conda environment
	conda activate random_features
	
4.  Run the make file to download all the datasets and preprocess.
         make data
         
5.  Run the notebooks.  

Remark: Always work in the newly created conda environment. Pls read the 
cookiecutter docs for best practices.
